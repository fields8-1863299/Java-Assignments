# Java-Assignments
Java assignments for University's Programming II course. Practice in data objects, interfaces, classes, data manipulation, recursion, recursive backtracking, binary trees, and binary tree traversals.

# Description of Assignments:
## Letter Inventory:
Practice using arrays and classes. Created a class called LetterInventory that can be used to keep track of an inventory of letters of the alphabet.  The constructor for the class takes a String and computes how many of each letter are in the String.  This is the information the object keeps track of (how many a’s, how many b’s, etc).

## Guitar:
Practice with queues, interfaces, objects, and arrays of objects. Created a class called GuitarString that models a vibrating
guitar string of a given frequency. This assignment was designed to practice working with and implementing classes and methods whose internal functionality we don't fully understand. 
<br>

## Assassin Manager:
Practice implementing a linked list. Created a class called AssassinManager that models a game of "Assassin" with methods essential to the functionality of the game. This assignment was designed to practice working with and manipulating linked lists.
<br>

## Evil Hangman:
Practice using the built in Java Map and Set collections. Created a class called HangmanManager which contains methods essential to a game of "evil" hangman in which the computer delays picking a word until it is forced to. As a result, the computer is always considering a set of words that could be the answer.
<br>

## Grammar Solver:
Practice with recursive programming, maps, and regular expressions. Created a class called GrammarSolver which allows for the generation of grammars based on given rules. Through a client file, the user can read in a text file of grammars which is then stored in a map to be used to randomly generate Strings and gramatically correct sentences.
<br>

## Anagram Solver:
Practice with recursive backtracking. Created a class called AnagramSolver which uses a dictionary to find all combinations of words that have the same letters as a given phrase (aka finds all anagrams of the word that exist in the dictionary).
<br>

## 20 Questions:
Practice with binary trees and recursion. 20 Questions is a guessing game in which the objective is to ask yes/no questions to determine an object. Created a class called QuestionsGame to represent the computer’s tree of yes/no questions and answers for playing games of 20 Questions. 
<br>

## Huffman Coding:
Practice with binary trees, priority queues, and recursion. Created a class called HuffmanCode and HuffmanNode which represents a “huffman code” used to compress data. Huffman coding is an algorithm devised by David A. Huffman of MIT in 1952 for compressing data to make a file occupy a smaller amount of space. Allows the user to create or pass through an encoding structure specific to their txt file to be used to compress or decompress their messages.
